            I&apos;m a senior full-stack developer with over 8 years of
            experience. While building websites and landing pages for my
            clients, I noticed they all had the same problem: marketing was a
            maze. They found lots of tips and strategies online, but putting
            those into action was a whole different story. More often than not,
            the advice was too complicated, hard to follow, or just didn&apos;t
            work, leaving them lost and unsure about what to do next.
          </p>

            I figured there had to be an easier way to get marketing that works.
            I believed in a clearer, simpler path to marketing successâ€”one that
            didn&apos;t just add to the confusion or lead nowhere. That&apos;s
            why I founded ScaleGrowth Marketing. Our mission is simple: to
            simplify the marketing process for service-based businesses.{" "}
