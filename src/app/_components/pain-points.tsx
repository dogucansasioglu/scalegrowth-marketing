        <div className="font-bold">Dear Business Owner,</div>
        <div>We get it.</div>
        <div>Growing a business is hard. Really hard.</div>
        <div>
          You’re probably worried about where your next customer will come from.
        </div>
        <div>Stressed and can’t sleep.</div>
        <div>Noticing more gray hairs lately? Yeah, that’s stress for you.</div>
        <div>And it doesn’t end with just a restless night...</div>
        <div>Come morning, it&apos;s a whole new world of decisions.</div>
        <div>Should I start blogging?</div>
        <div>Maybe launch a podcast?</div>
        <div>Or build a personal brand?</div>
        <div>Do cument my entire life on Instagram?</div>
        <div>What about chatbots?</div>
        <div>They’re everywhere now.</div>
        <div>Run some ads?</div>
        <div>Maybe it&apos;s time for a new look with a fresh logo?</div>
        <div>How about posting on LinkedIn more often?</div>
        <div>It can be overwhelming.</div>
        <div>Chasing the latest trend, you end up spread too thin.</div>
        <div>You&apos;re busy, but somehow, not getting ahead.</div>
        <div className="font-bold">The result?</div>
        <div>Nights spent working instead of sleeping,</div>
        <div>a to-do list that never ends,</div>
        <div>and a overwhelming feeling that just won&apos;t go away.</div>
        <div>We get how hard it can be...</div>
        <div>It feels like a never-ending struggle.</div>
        <div>
          This is what we call the{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">hell of business</span>
        </div>
        <div>It’s hot, suffocating, and unbearable.</div>
        <div>
          And honestly, we’d rather rub chili pepper in our eyes over running a
          business like that, any day.
        </div>
        <div>
          But this isn’t about us…{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">It’s about you.</span>
        </div>
        <div>You’re here because something isn’t quite right.</div>
        <div>Your business isn’t where you want it to be.</div>
        <div>Or maybe you’re flying… and you simply want more.</div>
        <div>More security.</div>
        <div>More revenue</div>
        <div className="font-bold">More freedom</div>
        <div>More memories</div>
        <div className="font-bold">More time with your family</div>
        <div>
          More of those dreams becoming reality, because you deserve it.
        </div>
        <div>
          Whatever <span className="font-bold">&apos;more&apos;</span> means to
          you...
        </div>
        <div>It all starts with one simple choice.</div>
        <div className="font-bold">*cue a ray of hope*</div>
